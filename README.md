## ‚ú® Key Features

### üéØ Two Game Modes - Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. **Find Letters Mode** üîç

**How It Works:**
1. **Letter Selection Algorithm**: 
   - Random selection from active letter set (uppercase/lowercase/mixed)
   - Avoids recent letters to prevent repetition
   - In rounds 2+, 60% chance to select from problem letters
   
2. **Option Generation**:
   - Creates 4 choices including the correct answer
   - Ensures no duplicate options
   - Randomly shuffles button positions to prevent pattern memorization
   
3. **Interaction Flow**:
   - Auto-plays "Find the letter X" instruction
   - Speaker button for repeat listening (unlimited replays)
   - Visual pulse animation draws attention to speaker
   - Each button responds with immediate visual feedback on click

4. **Phonics Integration**:
   - 3-second countdown after correct answer
   - Plays phonetic sound (e.g., "ah" for A, "buh" for B)
   - Reinforces letter-sound connection
   - Visual display of the letter during phonics phase

**Scoring Mechanics:**
- Response time tracking starts immediately after question display
- Dynamic point calculation based on speed
- Wrong answer penalty encourages careful thinking
- No penalty for replaying the audio

#### 2. **Draw Letters Mode** ‚úèÔ∏è

**Technical Implementation:**
- **HTML5 Canvas API** for drawing surface (350x350 pixels)
- **Touch Event Handling** for tablet/phone support
- **Mouse Event Support** for desktop users
- **Stroke Recording**: Captures all drawing points for analysis

**Drawing Features:**
- Line width: 8px for visibility
- Purple stroke color (#764ba2) for contrast
- Rounded line caps for smooth appearance
- Ghost letter guide at 15% opacity
- Prevents default touch behaviors (no scrolling/zooming during draw)

**Validation Logic:**
- Minimum 10 points required (prevents accidental taps)
- Simple validation based on stroke count and coverage
- 70% success rate for drawings with 30+ points
- Encouraging feedback regardless of accuracy

### üèÜ Advanced Gamification System

#### Star Progression Algorithm
```javascript
Stars Earned = Math.floor(score / 100)
Maximum Stars = 5
```
- Each star represents 100 points of achievement
- Visual feedback with filled (‚≠ê) and empty (‚òÜ) stars
- Persistent across game modes within session

#### Adaptive Difficulty System

**Round Progression Triggers:**
- 50 correct answers advance to next round
- Less than 5 wrong answers required for advancement
- Automatic round summary and statistics display

**Difficulty Scaling:**
- **Round 1**: 10-second timer, gentle introduction
- **Round 2+**: 8-second timer (reduced by 2 seconds)
- **Minimum Timer**: 5 seconds (prevents impossible difficulty)

**Problem Letter Intelligence:**
The game maintains a **letterErrors** object tracking mistakes:
```javascript
letterErrors = {
  'a': 3,  // Letter 'a' missed 3 times
  'h': 2,  // Letter 'h' missed 2 times
  // etc...
}
```
- Letters with 2+ errors marked as "problem letters"
- Top 6 problem letters prioritized in next round
- 60% probability of selecting problem letters in advanced rounds

#### Scoring Mathematics

**Point Calculation Formula:**
```
Base Points:
- Ultra-fast (< 2 sec): 50 points
- Fast (< 3 sec): 40 points  
- Normal (< 5 sec): 30 points
- Standard (5+ sec): 20 points

Penalties:
- Wrong answer: -15 points
- Timeout: -10 points
- Minimum score: 0 (never negative)
```

**Round Statistics Tracking:**
- Average response time calculation
- Accuracy percentage (correct/total * 100)
- Score delta from round start
- Problem letter identification

### üîä Audio System Deep Dive

#### Web Speech API Implementation

The game leverages the **Web Speech Synthesis API** for all audio feedback:

```javascript
// Speech configuration
utterance.rate = 0.8;     // Slower for clarity
utterance.pitch = 1.2;    // Higher pitch for child-friendly voice
utterance.volume = 1.0;   // Full volume
```

**Audio Types:**
1. **Letter Names**: Special handling for tricky letters (e.g., 'a' pronounced as "ay")
2. **Phonetic Sounds**: Mapped pronunciations for each letter
3. **Instructional Phrases**: "Find the letter", "Well done!", etc.
4. **Countdown Alerts**: Numbers spoken when timer reaches 3, 2, 1

**Phonetic Sound Map:**
```javascript
'a': 'ah as in apple',  'b': 'buh as in ball',
'c': 'kuh as in cat',   'd': 'duh as in dog',
'e': 'eh as in egg',    'f': 'fff as in fish',
// ... complete phonetic mappings with word examples for all 26 letters
```

**Speech Queue Management:**
- Cancels previous speech before new utterance
- Callback support for sequential audio
- Voice selection prioritizes English voices
- Fallback to default voice if English unavailable

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable Settings
- **Timer Control**: Turn timer on/off for stress-free learning
- **Letter Case Options**: 
  - Lowercase only
  - Uppercase only
  - Mixed case for advanced learners
- **Adaptive Timer**: Rounds get progressively faster

### Algorithm Details

#### Letter Selection Algorithm
```javascript
function getRandomLetter() {
    // 1. Base pool selection
    let pool = getLetterCollection(); // Based on case setting
    
    // 2. Problem letter prioritization (Round 2+)
    if (currentRound > 1 && problemLetters.length > 0) {
        if (Math.random() < 0.5) { // 50% chance
            pool = problemLetters;
        }
    }
    
    // 3. Recent letter filtering
    if (recentLetters.length > 0) {
        pool = pool.filter(l => !recentLetters.includes(l));
    }
    
    // 4. Random selection
    const selected = pool[Math.floor(Math.random() * pool.length)];
    
    // 5. Update recent letters (FIFO queue, max 3)
    recentLetters.push(selected);
    if (recentLetters.length > 3) recentLetters.shift();
    
    return selected;
}
```

#### Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
function calculatePoints(responseTime) {
    // Time-based scoring tiers
    if (responseTime < 2) return 50;      // Ultra-fast
    if (responseTime < 3) return 40;      // Fast
    if (responseTime < 5) return 30;      // Normal
    return 20;                            // Standard
    
    // Penalties applied separately:
    // Wrong answer: -15 points
    // Timeout: -10 points
    // Minimum score: 0 (never negative)
}
```

#### Drawing Validation System
```javascript
function validateDrawing(points) {
    // Minimum complexity check
    if (points.length < 10) return 'too_simple';
    
    // Stroke analysis
    if (points.length > 20) {
        // Calculate bounding box
        const bounds = calculateBounds(points);
        
        // Check coverage (simplified)
        if (bounds.width > 50 && bounds.height > 50) {
            return 'valid';
        }
    }
    
    return 'needs_improvement';
}
```
